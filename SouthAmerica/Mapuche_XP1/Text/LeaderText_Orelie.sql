		"Antoine De Tounens was a French adventurer who was born on the12th May in 1825 in the hamlet La Chèze at Chourgnac, not far from Tourtoirac. He died on the 17th September, 1878 at Tourtoirac. He was the eighth son of a farmers family with nine children. His parents were Jean Tounens and Catherine Jardon. He was a talented and sensitive child with a great interest in history."),
		
		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LEU_ORELIE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2",					
		"Antoine, with the support of his family, left in 1858 by ship, with a stop at Southampton, for Chile and arrived there on the 28th August, 1858. In the first two years he learned Spanish and made a lot of contacts."),

		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LEU_ORELIE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",					
		"He also got in contact with the Machupe Indians, who lived in the Auraucania region and were fighting the Chilean government for their independence. He decided to take their side and support them and in 1860 the Auraucania region had won its independence back. He must have had a lot of charisma, because on the 20 th November, 1860, at the age of 35 years, he was made King of Auraucania and Patagonia: Roi Orélie Antoine I de Tounens. In this way he claimed an extension of his kingdom beyond the Andes up to the Atlantic Ocean and the Strait of Magellan. And immediately he installed the French form of government."),
		
		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LEU_ORELIE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",					
		"Antoine counted on enthusiasm and support from France, that over the years had lost many of its colonies overseas, but France showed no interest and intention to help. He formed an army to fight again, and was captured and held prisoner by the Chilean army on the 5 th January, 1862. He was released with the help of the French Consul and returned to France in October 1862. Back home, his kingdom and title were not acknowledged and while fighting for his cause he ran only into brick walls."),

		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LEU_ORELIE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",					
		"During the years 1860-1862, the Kingdom of Auraucania and Patagonia, in a certain way, really existed. But the ministers Lachaise and Desfontaines, whose signatures we see on the royal acts, did not exist. The first name corresponds to la Chèze (the chair), the name of the hamlet where Antoine de Tounens was born, and the second to Les Fontaines, a hamlet not far from the first one."),

		"In The National Library one can find traces of a collection of signatures in favor of Antoine Tounens from the summer of 1866, especially in Bordeaux. He also found financial support and went back to Chile in 1869, where he stayed until 1871. Back in France he organized a third expedition, but when he arrived in ChilE he was almost immediately arrested, imprisoned and after 4 1/2 months released with the help of the French government. In 1876-1877 he returned to Chili for a fourth time, but got very ill and returned finally, to France.");
